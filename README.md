As a grad student, I am constantly reading papers in reading groups, for
my projects, for classes, etc. PlusWisdom represents a way to incentive
not only reading these papers, but also understanding them and coming up
with snappy commentary. It's going to also be a ruby on rails website, because
I feel the moral obligation to learn Ruby on Rails.  And I want other people to
use it.  It'll be fun, you guys!


-------------------------------------------------
In order to support the fact that this is an exercise in learning, I am, at
least to begin, following the framework for the
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example*](http://railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/).
